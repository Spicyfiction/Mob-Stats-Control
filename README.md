# Mob stat control

By default this mod does nothing, you need to open the config file in .minecraft/config/varied_monsters.cfg \
and change what stats mobs have to your heart's content. \
Mod works server side so no need for clients to have it when joining a server. \
The config file is created when launching the game.
